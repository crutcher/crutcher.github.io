I'm in the process of writing out some of the [Roadmaps](/roadmaps/)
I've been keeping for myself over the years.

These will be developed as ongoing projects; updated
when I have new information or more time to elaborate them.

The first one I'm sketching in is the [Hot Dense Grid](/roadmaps/hot_dense_grid/):
a roadmap to easy-to-develop, high-performance,
fully GPU/network saturated, datacenter-scale, sharded
space/time finite grid simulations.
